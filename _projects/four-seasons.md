<p>Cottleston Pie was brought in to collaborate with the Four Seasons web team on redesigning a few different areas of the site.</p>

<p>The booking flow is the most important experience of a hotel website. Cottleston Pie designed the booking experience on fourseasons.com. This update was so well received that we were able to employ a similar approach on other sections of the site.</p>

<p>We worked with the Four Seasons to improve not just the user experience, but also to make pages responsive to all device sizes. We placed a priority on page weight to improve the load speed across a few sections on the site.</p>
