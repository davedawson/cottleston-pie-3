	<p>On a mission to bring a livable wage to Los Angeles, Raise the Wage works on the ground with community activists to push for the minimum wage to be raised to $15.</p>

	<p> Cottleston Pie collaborated with Swell and Patronage to bring their campaign strategy to life. We created the branding for the campaign and translated that brand into the website design. </p>
