	<p>Instead of leaving the conference and losing touch with all of the inspiring people at the conference, we created a tool to help attendees of the conference connect with each other after the conference has ended. </p>

	<p>In collaboration with Tash Wong and Big Wheel Brigade, we developed a system that allowed attendees to subscribe to projects from people that may have heard from at the conference. Each week, a project leader writes a short update on the project and asks a few questions. The subscribers are able to help the project leader by answering questions or providing feedback. </p>
