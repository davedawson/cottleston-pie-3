<p>Cottleston Pie was brought on to redesign the homepage to focus on the stories being told. The creative team at Nextgen went into the field and intereviewed community activists of people who have been affected by climate change.</p> 

<p>We were able to use the amazing photography to tell the stories of Americans who are being affected by climate change and motivate users to take action.</p>
