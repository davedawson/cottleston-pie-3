intro: Designing Paul Allen's push to Tackle Ebola  
---

{% contentfor description %}
	
	<p>Cottleston Pie was brought in to help quickly build out the Tackle Ebola campaign. Fueled by the passion of The Paul G. Allen Family Foundation and in collaboration with Patronage, and in a rapid-response fashion, we concepted, designed and built the initial Tackle Ebola website in three days. The campaign was a response to the Ebola epidemic and to funnel donations to organizations that make the biggest impact with the money. </p>

	<p>We were able to iterate on the website over the course of the campaign. As the epidemic slowed down, we were able to transition the website to a storytelling platform for people who have survived Ebola. </p>
