<p>In collaboration with Fourclops, we created a world that allowed the people of the internet to control the actions of a man in the woods. The Old Spice Nature Adventure was a three day event that placed a man in the woods, strapped with cameras, live streaming on twitch.tv. The people in the Twitch chatroom wrote their suggestions, and then NatureMan carried them out. </p>

<p>Cottleston Pie was brought on to create the overlay graphics for the gameplay and well as design the microsite for the project to live on once the event was over.</p>
