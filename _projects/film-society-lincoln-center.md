<p>After working with The Film Society of Lincoln Center for a few years on iterative website updates, they asked us if weâ€™d be interested in helping them rethink their digital experience from the ground-up. Obviously, we jumped at the opportunity. </p>

<p>Having worked with FilmLinc for over five years, we had an a pretty good idea of how the website worked. But we decided to throw all of that away and start fresh. We began the design process with a site audit and a card sorting exercise with the project stakeholders. This allowed us to gain intimate knowledge of how FilmLinc views the website internally and the goals that the site is supposed to achieve. </p>

<p>From that conversation, we were able to begin putting together wireframes of the new website. In collaboration with the FilmLinc team, we created new content structures for the site that made sense the organization, and not just for the CMS. </p>

<p>After all of our research and conversations, the visual design came together pretty seamlessly. FilmLinc has an extremely strong and recognized brand. Playing off of that brand and the still photos from the films made the design of this site a piece of cake. </p>
