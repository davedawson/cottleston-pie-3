<p>In preparation for the 2017 incoming class, the team at Yale Admissions was looking to update their website to a modern, responsive site. More and more prospective students and parents/guardians were visiting the outdated admissions website on different sized screens, and the site wasnâ€™t representing the school well.</p>

<p>In a collaboration with Pamela Holland and Erin Knutson, we worked directly with the Yale Admissions office, to layout the most important content for prospective students who are looking to get an idea of what life at Yale is like. </p>

<p>Taking a mobile first approach, we considered the smallest screen size first, creating a simple information hierarchy that pushed the most important information to the front. We knew that a large percentage of users would be viewing the site on their mobile devices, so we worked with the Admissions team to prioritize the relevant content.</p>

<p>The Yale brand is established. Our job on the visual design was to ensure that the brand was being represented accurately and that the Admissions website matched their stellar offline reputation.</p>
