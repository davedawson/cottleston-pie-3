	<p>In partnership with Fourclops, we designed a mashup engine for Avicii fans as a promotion for the 2014 album, True. As one of the biggest names in electronic music, Avicii has a massive audience, especially geared towards internet culture. Avicii TrueTube is a platform that allows users to mashup their favorite Avicii tracks with any video on Youtube. We put the platform online and let the Internet run wild with it. The result is pretty incredible. Mashups beyond what we could have imagined. One of our favorites is <a href="http://truetu.be/#watch/eNV01h4OBQ">You Make Michel</a></p>

	<p>We designed the overall look and feel of the site as well as the interface for the mashup editor.</p>
