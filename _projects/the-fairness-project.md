<p>This was both a national and state-level initiative. Both of which needed campaign websites. </p>

<p>Our task was to create a design system that worked for the national level campaign, but could be translated to state-level campaign sites. We created system that allowed The Fairness Project to spin up a new state-level site as soon as a new state joined the initiative. </p>

<p>Our UX role here was not only focused on the public users of the website, but also on the state-level organizers. We needed to create a system that was flexible enough to accommodate the needs of the organizers, but also kept within content structure that worked for all of the sites. </p>

<p>We started the project focused on the national campaign site, thefairnessproject.org. All the while, considering how each design decision would impact the flexible system we created for state-level sites. </p>

<p>States needed to be able to customize their websites to fit their unique campaign branding. The system we created allowed organizers to select a few colors and images to personalize their campaignâ€™s website.</p>
