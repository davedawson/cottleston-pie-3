	<p>Families for Excellent Schools is an organization pushing the movement to ensure all kids have great schools. In partnership with Patronage, we created a website to support the organization as well as the many campaigns that they run. </p>

	<p>We built the site from the ground-up, collaborating with the organization on content-strategy and creating a flexible system that will allow the website to grow as quickly as the organization is growing. </p>
