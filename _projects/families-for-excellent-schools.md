<p> In partnership with Patronage, we created a website to support the organization as well as the many campaigns that they run.</p>

<p>We built the site from the ground-up, collaborating with the organization on content-strategy and creating a flexible system that will allow the website to grow as quickly as the organization's reach.</p>

<p>Each campaign has a unique look &amp; feel, so we created a modular design that allows <abbr>FES</abbr> to tailor each campaign section to that branding.</p>
