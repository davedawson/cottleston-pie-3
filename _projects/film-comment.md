	<p>Film Comment is published by The Film Society of Lincoln Center. Cottleston Pie was tasked with bringing this print magazine's online precense up to date with the print edition of the magazine. This included breaking the site down and considering what user's will be looking for in a print magazine's website. </p>

	<p>We approached the project from a mobile-first perspective, considering the simplest for of the content to start and only adding additional content on larger screens when it made sense for the users.</p>
