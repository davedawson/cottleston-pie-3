<p>We partnered with Muckfest to redesign the user experience of the Muckfest event registration flow. The site was using an out-of-the-box solution, and the organization was ready to invest in a custom solution that fit their unique requirements and their userâ€™s goals. </p>

<p>The redesign process included a UX audit of the existing system,  presenting suggested improvements to the process. </p>

<p>Our redesign needed to fit within the technical restrictions of the CRM software we were using, so part of the project was balancing the user experience goals against the technical restrictions, and the business goals. </p>

<p>We came out of the project with clear UX recommendations, which were implemented by the Muckfest design team and Patronage.</p>
