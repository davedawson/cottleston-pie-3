	<p>LittleBits is a company that encourages kids to prototype and play with technology. Cottleston Pie was brought on to rework the Bit and Kit pages. We wanted to showcase how easy the Bits are to use and snap together. Beautiful pieces of hardware that they are, the bits became the focus of the design, allowing them to sell themselves.</p>
