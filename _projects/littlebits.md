<p>Cottleston Pie was brought in to collaborate with the LittleBits team to rework their website. As the number of products offered grows, the website needs to grow with them. </p>

<p>We wanted to showcase how easy the Bits are to use and snap together. Beautiful pieces of hardware that they are, the bits became the focus of the design, allowing them to sell themselves.</p>
