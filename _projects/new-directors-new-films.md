	<p>In partnership with MoMA, the festival serves a showcase of first time directors.</p>

	<p>Each year, an artist creates a new poster for the festival. The website is meant to reflect the style of that poster and the festivalâ€™s branding. We developed the overall look and feel for the festival website in a flexible way that can be easily updated each year to reflect the new festival poster. </p>
