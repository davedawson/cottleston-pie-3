<p>In partnership with Fourclops, we designed a mashup engine for Avicii fans as a promotion for the 2014 album, True. As one of the biggest names in electronic music, Avicii has a massive audience, especially geared towards internet culture. </p>

<p>Avicii TrueTube is a platform that allows users to mashup their favorite Avicii tracks with any video on Youtube. We put the platform online and let the Internet run wild with it. The result is pretty incredible. Mashups beyond what we could have imagined. One of our favorite mashups is <a href="http://truetu.be/#watch/eNV01h4OBQ">You Make Michel</a>.</p>

<p>We designed the overall look and feel of the site as well as the interface for the mashup editor.</p>

<p> In partnership with Patronage, we created a website to support the organization as well as the many campaigns that they run.</p>

<p>We built the site from the ground-up, collaborating with the organization on content-strategy and creating a flexible system that will allow the website to grow as quickly as the organization's reach.</p>

<p>Each campaign has a unique look &amp; feel, so we created a modular design that allows <abbr>FES</abbr> to tailor each campaign section to that branding.</p>

<p><em>Film Comment</em> is a bi-monthly printed magazine published by <em>The Film Society of Lincoln Center</em>. Cottleston Pie was tasked with creating a website that allows the publication to feature more printed content online, as well as publish exclusive online content.</p>
<p>Approaching the project from a mobile first perspective, we completely stripped out the original site structure and started from scratch, reorganizing and creating content types and labels that make sense for the online version of a print magazine.</p>
<p>Subtle design elements tie the visuals of the site to the printed magazine, but allow for much more flexiblility to showcase some of the beautiful imagery and quirky writing of the magazine.</p>

<p>After working with The Film Society of Lincoln Center for a few years on iterative website updates, they asked us if we’d be interested in helping them rethink their digital experience from the ground-up. Obviously, we jumped at the opportunity. </p>

<p>Having worked with FilmLinc for over five years, we had an a pretty good idea of how the website worked. But we decided to throw all of that away and start fresh. We began the design process with a site audit and a card sorting exercise with the project stakeholders. This allowed us to gain intimate knowledge of how FilmLinc views the website internally and the goals that the site is supposed to achieve. </p>

<p>From that conversation, we were able to begin putting together wireframes of the new website. In collaboration with the FilmLinc team, we created new content structures for the site that made sense the organization, and not just for the CMS. </p>

<p>After all of our research and conversations, the visual design came together pretty seamlessly. FilmLinc has an extremely strong and recognized brand. Playing off of that brand and the still photos from the films made the design of this site a piece of cake. </p>

<p>Cottleston Pie was brought in to collaborate with the Four Seasons web team on redesigning a few different areas of the site.</p>

<p>The booking flow is the most important experience of a hotel website. Cottleston Pie designed the booking experience on fourseasons.com. This update was so well received that we were able to employ a similar approach on other sections of the site.</p>

<p>We worked with the Four Seasons to improve not just the user experience, but also to make pages responsive to all device sizes. We placed a priority on page weight to improve the load speed across a few sections on the site.</p>

<p>Gary Hustwit approached Cottleston Pie to help wrangle in his many projects into one cohesive website. Each film and book of Gary’s was originally housed under it’s own website and domain name.</p>

<p>We collaborated with Gary to create a website that allowed all of his projects to live under one roof. We also created a flexible system for future projects, which can easily be added to the website. </p>

<p>Cottleston Pie was brought in to collaborate with the LittleBits team to rework their website. As the number of products offered grows, the website needs to grow with them. </p>

<p>We wanted to showcase how easy the Bits are to use and snap together. Beautiful pieces of hardware that they are, the bits became the focus of the design, allowing them to sell themselves.</p>

<p>In partnership with MoMA, the festival serves a showcase of first time directors.</p>

<p>Each year, an artist creates a new poster for the festival. The website is meant to reflect the style of that poster and the festival’s branding. We developed the overall look and feel for the festival website in a flexible way that can be easily updated each year to reflect the new festival poster. </p>

<p>Cottleston Pie was brought on to redesign the homepage to focus on the stories being told. The creative team at Nextgen went into the field and intereviewed community activists of people who have been affected by climate change.</p>

<p>We were able to use the amazing photography to tell the stories of Americans who are being affected by climate change and motivate users to take action.</p>

<p>In collaboration with Fourclops, we created a world that allowed the people of the internet to control the actions of a man in the woods. The Old Spice Nature Adventure was a three day event that placed a man in the woods, strapped with cameras, live streaming on twitch.tv. The people in the Twitch chatroom wrote their suggestions, and then NatureMan carried them out. </p>

<p>Cottleston Pie was brought on to create the overlay graphics for the gameplay and well as design the microsite for the project to live on once the event was over.</p>

<p>On a mission to bring a livable wage to Los Angeles, Raise the Wage works on the ground with community activists to push for the minimum wage to be raised to $15.</p>

<p> Cottleston Pie collaborated with Swell and Patronage to bring their campaign strategy to life. We created the branding for the campaign and translated that brand into the website design. </p>

<p>Cottleston Pie was brought in to help quickly build out the Tackle Ebola campaign. Fueled by the passion of The Paul G. Allen Family Foundation and in collaboration with Patronage, and in a rapid-response fashion, we concepted, designed and built the initial Tackle Ebola website in three days.</p>

<p>The campaign was a response to the Ebola epidemic and to funnel donations to organizations that make the biggest impact with the money. </p>

<p>We were able to iterate on the website over the course of the campaign. As the epidemic slowed down, we were able to transition the website to a storytelling platform for people who have survived Ebola. </p>
