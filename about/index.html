		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>We work with organizations to design and build things used on screens. From conception to delivery (and every step in between), Cottleston Pie takes a wholistic approach to digital design.</p>

		<p>Cottleston Pie specializes in responsive web design and development as well as UX & UI Design. Available for full projects or as an individual consultant.</p>

		<p>Each project we take on is unique and every client has different needs. When we get a new project, we assemble a team made up of people who have the skills that the project requires. This allows us to create the perfect team for your project without the overhead of a full-time staff. </p>
