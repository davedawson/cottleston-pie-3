	    	<p>We work with organizations to design and build things used on screens. From conception to delivery (and every step in between), Cottleston Pie takes a holistic approach to digital design.</p>

				<p>Cottleston Pie specializes in responsive web design and development as well as UX & UI Design. Available for full projects or as an individual consultant.</p>

				<p>Each project we take on is unique and every client has different needs. When we get a new project, we assemble a team made up of people who have the skills that the project requires. This allows us to create the perfect team for your project without the overhead of a full-time staff. </p>

				<p>Based out of The Works coworking space (which is a Cottleston Pie project), we host community events and cultivate an eclectic mix of people.</p>
