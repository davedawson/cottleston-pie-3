	    	<p>We work with organizations to design and build websites and apps. From conception to delivery (and every step in between), Cottleston Pie takes a holistic approach to design.</p>

				<p><strong>Cottleston Pie specializes in full service responsive web design and development as well as UX &amp; UI Design. Available for full projects or as an individual consultant.</strong></p>

				<p>Each project is unique and every client has different needs. Why should the team remain the same for each? We assemble a team specific to each project, made up of people who have the skills to knock that project out of the park. This allows us to design the perfect team for your project without the overhead of a full-time staff.</p>

				<p>A few of our favorite teams to work with include, <a href="http://www.patronage.org">Patronage</a>, <a href="http://www.precisionstrategies.com/">Precision Strategies</a>, <a href="http://swellcreativegroup.com/">Swell</a> and <a href="http://www.fourclops.com">Fourclops</a>.</p>

				<p>Based out of The Works coworking space (which is a Cottleston Pie project), we host community events and cultivate an eclectic mix of people.</p>
